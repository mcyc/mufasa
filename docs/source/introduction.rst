Introduction to MUFASA
======================

What is MUFASA?
---------------
MUFASA (**MUlti-component Fitter for Astrophysical Spectral Applications**) is a Python library designed to automate multi-component spectral fitting for astrophysical molecular lines, particularly ones with hyperfine structures. The library also provide visualization tools to support model inspection and data analysis.

Key Features
------------
- **Multi-Component Spectral Fitting**:
  Fit spectra with multiple velocity components, ideal for analyzing regions with overlapping or blended signals.
- **Data Visualization**:
  Create high-quality plots to interpret spectral data effectively, including:
  - Fitted spectra with components.
  - Position-Position-Velocity (PPV) scatter plots.

Applications
------------
MUFASA is designed for astronomers and astrophysicists working with:
- Molecular spectral line observations.
- Position-Position-Velocity (PPV) data cubes.
- Data from radio, millimeter, and sub-millimeter telescopes.

Why Choose MUFASA?
